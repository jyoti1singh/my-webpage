   abstract = {Apple is the fourth important fruit crop of India after Mango, Citrus and Banana. Himachal Pradesh is the second largest producer of apple after Jammu and Kashmir (Chadha, 2001). Apple cultivation is economically rewarding which helps in boosting financial status of farmers and provides them better standards for living in Himachal Pradesh. Recently impact of global climate change on agriculture has been reported as one of the alarming phenomenon and Himalayas are among those region which will witness rapid climate change causing severe damage to environment, economics and society of Himalaya and its habitants (Chaudhary and Bawa, 2011). The observed climatic trends over northwestern Himalayas showed a significant increasing in mean and maximum temperature over time period of 1951-2010 (Rathore et al., 2013). Adverse impact of climate change in Western Himalayas on apple producing areas and productivity is being reported in recent decades (Rana et al., 2009; Chaudhary and Bawa, 2011; Basannagari and Kala, 2013). Kullu valley the apple belt of state has gone under sharp decline of apple productivity and apple orchards had been replaced by vegetables and fruit varieties (with lower chilling requirements) in several areas.The increase in minimum temperature was more for the lower elevation areas (below 700 m amsl) as compared to higher elevation areas (Rana et al. 2012).Hence, areas at higher altitudes are becoming more suitable for apple cultivation like Lahaul and Spiti (Rana et al., 2011). Apple cultivation is being replaced by other stone fruits in lower altitudes and expanding towards upper altitudes (Rana et al., 2009). The temperature trends in apple growing regions of Kullu and Shimla districts of Himachal Pradesh indicated 1.8 to 4.1°C rise in past few decades which reflected in decrease of effective chill units (ECU) hours accumulations (Rana et al., 2011).Addressing the negative impacts of warming on deciduous fruits, a comprehensive and spatially distributed information on chilling requirements from chill unit models are crucial (Luedeling and Brown, 2011). In this study, a geographical information system (GIS) was employed to map spatial extent of chilling zones under changing climate based on the principles of UTAH chill unit model. Chilling zones were later used to delineate suitable classes for apple cultivation and shift in apple belt over Himachal Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS Climate data and processing The gridded climatic data from 1969 to 2013 were obtained from National Climate Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).From this, the temperature and precipitation data for Himachal Pradesh region were extracted. After extraction 1 ×1 degree gridded daily temperature data contains 4 × 5 grid points. The latitude ranges from 29.5° to 33.5° N having 4 grids and longitude ranges from 74.5° to 79.5° E having 5 grids. The precipitation data at 0.25×0.25 degree grid covers daily precipitation data contains 14×16 grid points. Its latitude ranges from 30° to 33.5° N having 14 grids and longitude ranges from 75.25° ABSTRACT Apple crop require adequate chilling for breaking its winter dormancy for a usual spring growth. In this study, suitability of apple production was assessed by using GIS based UTAH chill unit model for tactical and strategic adaptation options under changed climatic scenarios. This analysis consists o f spatial chilling zonation from year 1978-2013,delineation of suitability classes for apple productio n based on effective chill units(ECU), and shift in apple belt in Himachal Pradesh under changing climate. The result showed spatial extent of chilling zone having ECU>1500 has declined. The traditional apple crop areas are shifting upward in Himachal Pradesh as a result less suitable areas transforming in unsuitable and severely cold areas which were earlier not suitable are becoming suitable for apple cultivation.},

   abstract = {Using Hadley Global Environment Model 2 - Earth System and Max Planck Institute Earth System Model simulations, we assess the impact of global warming and stratospheric geoengineering on deciduous fruit production in Himachal Pradesh (the second-largest apple-producing state in India). The impacts have been assessed for the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) global warming scenario, and a corresponding geoengineered scenario (G3) from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, in which stratospheric aerosols are increased for 50 years from 2020 through 2069 to balance the global warming radiative forcing, and then aerosol precursor emissions are terminated. We used the period 2055–2069 (with the largest geoengineering forcing) and the period 2075–2089 (beginning 5 years into the termination phase) and evaluated winter chill and growing season heat accumulation. We found that although stratospheric geoengineering would be able to suppress the increase in temperature under an RCP4.5 scenario to some extent during both switch-on and switch-off periods, if the geoengineering was terminated, the rate of temperature increase would be higher than RCP4.5. The agroclimatically suitable area is projected to shift northeastwards (to higher elevations) under RCP4.5 as well as G3 during both periods. However, during the switched on period, geoengineering would restrict the shift, and areas of Shimla and Mandi districts (most suitable under the current climate) would not be lost due to global warming. Even during the switched off period, before the climate returned to RCP4.5 levels, the above areas would, although to a lesser extent, have reduced harmful climate effects from global warming. However, the area of suitable land (the intersection of soil and agroclimatic suitability) would decrease in both periods for RCP4.5 as well as G3, because as more high-elevation regions become agroclimatically suitable, they do not have suitable soils to support cultivation. Geoengineering could benefit deciduous fruit production by reducing the intensity of global warming; however, if geoengineering was terminated abruptly, the rate of change in temperature would be quite high. This could lead to a rapid change in land suitability and might result in total crop failure in a shorter period compared to RCP4.5.},

   abstract = {Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 237 million, is the largest agrarian state in India, located in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Rice cultivation is widespread across all districts of Uttar Pradesh, which have varying climate regimes, irrigation infrastructures, crop management practices, and farm sizes. The state is characterized by different agroecological zones (AEZs) with semi-arid to sub-humid climates with significant variability in monsoon rainfall. In this study, the impact of climate change on Kharif-season rice is estimated using crop-climate scenarios in Uttar Pradesh. A process-based Crop Simulation Model, Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis-Rice, was simulated with bias-corrected and downscaled climate data for historical (1995–2014) and three future periods (the 2030s, 2050s, and 2090s) for two mitigation pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. Phenology, irrigation amount, crop evapotranspiration, yield, and water use efficiency were evaluated and assessed for all AEZs. Based on the ensemble of 16 climate models, rainfed rice yield increased in the AEZs of western Uttar Pradesh due to increased rainfall, while in eastern Uttar Pradesh yield decreased, under both shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Irrigated rice yield decreased in all AEZs under both SSPs due to an increase in temperature and a decrease in the length of the growing period, with reductions of up to 20% by the 2090s. Irrigation requirements decreased from the 2030s to the 2090s due to increased rainfall and decreased crop evapotranspiration. Despite the projected increase in rainfed yield, the overall rice yield is expected to decrease in the future under both SSPs.},
