## About Me

I am a postdoctoral associate at Rutgers University. My research focuses on improving crop models to represent crop processes better. I investigate the interaction of plants with tropospheric ozone, specifically how plants are affected under chronic ozone exposure. I am working on enhancing winter and spring wheat representation in the Community Land Model (CLM). Additionally, my research includes statistical downscaling of GCM outputs and forcing them into crop models for regional impact assessment on crops, plants, and fruits. My work aims to understand how agriculture will be affected by climate intervention strategies.
